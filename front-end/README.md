# Project Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for our project. Below are instructions on how to set up and run the frontend locally.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend development environment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```
    cd front-end
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend server:

```
npm start
```

This command will start a development server and open the application in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser, making the development process efficient and straightforward.

- Make everything editable (sets, matches, tournamentts, number of matches)
- Buttons hovering fix it, some cursors headers (divs to btns)
